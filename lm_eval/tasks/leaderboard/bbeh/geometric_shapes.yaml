      1. rectangle that is not a square and with no diagonals drawn

      2. square with no diagonals drawn

      3. triangle that is not a right triangle

      4. right triangle

      5. parallelogram that is not a rectangle and with no diagonals drawn

      8. irregular concave pentagon with no diagonals drawn

      9. regular pentagon with no diagonals drawn

      10. regular hexagon with no diagonals drawn

      which one(s) can be viewed when the lines in the SVG are visualized? Note that a shape with n sides should not necessarily be drawn by n lines; e.g., a triangle might be drawn by 4 lines, two of which collinear.
