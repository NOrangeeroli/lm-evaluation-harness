  - input: 'You are an expert in word sorting. You will be provided with a list of words and the steps taken, in the form of thoughts, to arrange them in alphabetical order.

      Your job is to identify the first step that was a mistake in reasoning about the order of the words. This can be misunderstanding the order of the alphabet or getting the word or letter wrong or missing a word entirely.

      Q: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: cat apple banana

      Thought 1: I should start by looking at the first letter of the words in the list. The first letter: "cat": "c" (3). "apple": "a" (1). "banana": "b" (2).

      Thought 2: We now have: (1) "apple" < (2) "banana" < (3) "cat".

      Thought 3: I have now sorted all the words. The answer is apple banana cat

      Q: Is there a mistake in this sequence? Write "No" if there are no mistakes, or the number N if there is a mistake in Thought N.'

      Q: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: zebra ant dog

      Thought 1: I should start by looking at the first letter of the words in the list. The first letter: "zebra": "z" (26). "ant": "a" (1). "dog": "d" (4).

      Thought 2: We now have: (1) "ant" < (4) "dog" < (26) "zebra".

      Thought 3: I have now sorted all the words. The answer is ant zebra dog

      Q: Is there a mistake in this sequence? Write "No" if there are no mistakes, or the number N if there is a mistake in Thought N.'

      Q: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: moon sun star

      Thought 1: I should start by looking at the first letter of the words in the list. The first letter: "moon": "m" (13). "sun": "s" (19). "star": "s" (19).

      Thought 2: We now have: (13) "moon" < (19) ["sun" ? "star"].

      Thought 3: Now let''s sort this subpart ["sun" ? "star"] by looking at their second letters. The second letter: "sun": "u" (21). "star": "t" (20).

      Thought 4: We now have: (20) "star" < (21) "sun" for the subpart. Hence, we have "moon" < "star" < "sun".

      Thought 5: I have now sorted all the words. The answer is moon star sun
