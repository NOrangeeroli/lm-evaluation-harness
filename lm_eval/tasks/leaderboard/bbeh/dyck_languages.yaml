  - input: 'You are an expert in a language called dyck where you must complete the language sequence of unclosed brackets of all types (e.g., [], {}, <>). You are given an initial initial dyck language sequence and the steps, provided as thoughts, that were used to arrive at the closing bracket sequence in the dyck language. Your job is to identify the first step that was a mistake in reasoning about the closing bracket sequence in dyck language, if any. This can be forgetting to close a bracket or closing with the wrong bracket or incorrectly copying the prior subsequence of closing brackets to the next step.

      Task: Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: ( [ ) ]

      Thought 1: We should process each input one by one and keep track of the stack configuration.

      Thought 2: stack: empty

      Thought 7: Now, we have reached the end. The final stack is empty.
