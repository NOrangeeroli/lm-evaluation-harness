  - input: 'A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The lion has 20 coins. The tiger has 30 coins. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the lion has at least 40 coins, then the tiger has at least 40 coins. Rule2: If the tiger has at least 40 coins, then the game ends. Rule1 is preferred over Rule2. If a rule is preferred over the other, it means whenever both of them can be applied to derive new conclusions and those conclusions contradict with each other (e.g., from one we derive X and from the other we derive not X), we should go with the conclusion from the rule with higher preference. Based on the facts, rules, and preferences, what is the truth value of the statement, does the game ends? Answer ''proved'' if it can be proved, ''disproved'' if it can be disproved, and ''unknown'' if it can neither be proved nor disproved.'
